"""Planner main loop + followup-message injection.

The async generator :func:`run_planner_session` is the public entry
point. It snapshots the graph (drift detection), narrows the tool
catalog per stage, calls the LLM, dispatches each tool call through
the executor in ``mode="stage"`` (or ``mode="apply"`` for ``agent_live``),
and yields :class:`PlannerEvent`s that the SSE wrapper streams.

Every failure mode becomes a typed ``PlannerEvent`` — the generator
never raises so the route handler can close the SSE cleanly without a
structured exception escaping the boundary.

    * ``"user_message"`` — the user typed a new instruction after a
      ``complete`` / ``awaiting_user_input``. The text is appended verbatim

    **Why ``role="user"`` instead of ``role="tool"``** — a ``role="tool"``

    ``tool_calls`` carries the matching ``tool_call_id``. By the time the

    message would be rejected by litellm / Anthropic / OpenAI on the next

    sent feedback" and works across every provider.

    The function mutates ``session.messages`` in place and returns the
